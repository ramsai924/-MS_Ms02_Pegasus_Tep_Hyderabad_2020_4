# what is sudoku ?

A Sudoku puzzle is defined as a logic-based, number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits in such a way that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 grids that make up the larger 9×9 grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. Each Sudoku puzzle begins with some cells filled in. The player uses these seed numbers as a launching point toward finding the unique solution.

# The Rules of Sudoku

While solving Sudoku puzzles can be significant challenge, the rules for traditional solution finding are quite straight forward:
1.Each row, column, and nonet can contain each number (typically 1 to 9) exactly once.
2.The sum of all numbers in any nonet, row, or column must match the small number printed in its corner. For traditional Sudoku puzzles featuring the numbers 1 to 9, this sum is equal to 45.The sum of all numbers in any nonet, row, or column must match the small number printed in its corner. For traditional Sudoku puzzles featuring the numbers 1 to 9, this sum is equal to 45.

This is an important point to review as it isn’t uncommon for inexperienced players to get frustrated and to abandon the techniques we will lay out below. Don’t do it! In order to solve Sudoku puzzles reliably, you must be disciplined, focused, and patient.

# How to Solve Sudoku Puzzles

There are two main techniques one can use to solve a Sudoku puzzle; Crosshatching and Penciling In. These two techniques are simple, straightforward, reliable, and sufficient in solving most standard Sudoku puzzles.


It is important to understand that all Sudoku puzzles require an iterative approach. Except for in the case of the most simple puzzles, players will have to visit each nonet more than one time. Fortunately, each successive application of the solution techniques yields more completed cells.
